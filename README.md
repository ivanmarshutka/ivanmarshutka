I am an aspiring SOC analyst with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

My journey in cybersecurity has led me to develop a passion for blue team work, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
